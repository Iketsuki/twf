#Lesson Plan

###Introduction (30 mins)

* Introduce volunteers, and why we were inspired to run this programme.
* Question: What is a computer programmer?
	*  Video: Code Stars (1 min) - http://youtu.be/dU1xS07N-FA
* Unbox RaspberryPi.
	* Remind students not to touch the electrical parts, and to place it down on anti-static bag.
	* Video: What is a Raspberry Pi? - http://www.raspberrypi.org/
	* Encourage students to figure out how to connect and power-on the Raspberry Pi (power cable goes last!).
* Explain how we'll run the class.
	* Video:  Pair Programming (from code.org)
	* Two students will work together to figure out the programming, with guidance from volunteers.
	* Must complete 'Measures Of Success' (objectives) before moving on to next section. 
	* English is the language of instruction; can switch to Cantonese, but not all instructors speak Cantonese so might put some at a disadvantage.
