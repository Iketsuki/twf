#Angry Birds

* Based on Chapter 2 (Making your own Angry Birds Game) from ‘[Raspberry Pi Projects for Kids](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Projects-Kids-Daniel-Bates/dp/1783982225)’ (PACKT Publishing) by Daniel Bates
* [Scratch help and tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/help/) 

###Instructor Notes
* Encourage students to follow their curiosity and depart from lesson plan (keeping within time limits so everyone moves ahead together).
* Answer questions by asking students to try it and see (not just show & tell).
* There will be a short class-wide presentation before the start of each objective to explain what is expected. 
* The Chapter is for instructors only; share the objectives with the students but not the answers in the chapter.

###Introduction (10 mins)

###Creating a character, Creating a level (30 mins)
* How large is my stage, in pixels? Where is x=0, y=0?
* How can I tell the x, y where my mouse is pointing?
* Zoom out in editor to see the entire canvas.
* Don’t forget to save!

###Moving with the keyboard, Launch, Flight, Physics (60 mins)
* How can I make my sprite move faster? Slower?
* The flight code is complex; first move by fixed x,y and then build the formula. Don’t get stuck on the formula but make sure to understand how assignment of ‘x speed’ and ‘y speed’ works.

###Scoring, Extensions (30 mins)
* Local (sprite) vs Global (all sprites) variables.
* Add sounds (launch, hit enemy).
* Add animation (hop on slingshot, launch, hit enemy).
